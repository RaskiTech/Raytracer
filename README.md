# Raytracer

A cool interactive CPU raytracer made with c++. Look around with your mouse, and move with the wasd-keys. The application will re-render the screen when necessary.

SDL used to generate a window to render to, and GLM used for a math library.
Change qulity settings in Raytracer/src/Constants.h. Make sure to run in release mode for optimal performance.
